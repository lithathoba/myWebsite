        <h1 class="h1" > About Me </h1>
        <h2>I am a highly motivated and ambitious individual with a proven track record of diligence in administrative and clerical work, specifically when I worked unpaid at a telecommunications firm where I had to manage multiple priorities and meet tight deadlines. I was in moot court competitions and debate teams where I proved that I am a quick learner who thrives in fast-paced environments, with excellent communication skills, and can work independently and collaboratively. I am committed to continuous learning and professional development, always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. When I'm not attempting coding projects or reading, I can be found volunteering at the local SPCA. I hope my knowledge of quantative techniques, economics, human resource information systems and my expert-level computer skill bring value to organisations.</h2> <h2><em>"You have as much right as the rich and the mighty. Don't hesitate to satisfy your needs; indeed, expand your needs and demand more."- Fyodor Dostoevksy </em> </h2>
